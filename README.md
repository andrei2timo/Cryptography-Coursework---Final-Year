# Cryptography-Coursework---Final-Year
Projects written in Java programming language for UFCFT4-15-3	CRYPTOGRAPHY module university's coursework. The projects includes Error Detection and Correction of Hamming codes, BCH codes, ISBN and Credit Card Number Validator, Luhn's algorithms and a Stream Cipher Encryptor/Decryptor knowing the key and Hiding Data into plain text using steganographic techniques. Design and use of password-cracking techniques, such as: Brute Force, Dictionaries, and Rainbow Tables. The documentation attached to these projects demonstrates that the knowledge obtained on the module has been successfully applied to a project that combines aspects from previous modules studied at University.

Brute-force BCH codes, Brute-force letters & digits, and Rainbow Table files use added JAR for commons-lang3-3.12.0. BCH encode and decode file uses added JAR for swing-layout-1.0.2.
